##  About the Project

This project is an API designed to work with the edunate App developed during the Flutterwave and Reloadly Hackathon in Sept-21. This is a simple CRUD api that enables the app to create users, authenticate logins, create, update and delete running projects by the users.

The API is built using nodeJS and connected to a MongoDB database using mongoose. To upload images we used the multer library and payment integrations using flutterwave and reloadly apis
